                A manic and impulsive criminal from Zaun, Jinx lives to wreak
                havoc without care for the consequences. With an arsenal of
                deadly weapons, she unleashes the loudest blasts and brightest
                explosions to leave a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake.

              <p>
                A brilliant yet eccentric yordle scientist, Professor Cecil B.
                Heimerdinger is one of the most innovative and esteemed
                inventors Piltover has ever known. Relentless in his work to the
                point of neurotic obsession, he thrives on answering the
                universe's most impenetrable questions.

                Decisive in judgment and lethal in combat, Katarina is a Noxian
                assassin of the highest caliber. Eldest daughter to the
                legendary General Du Couteau, she made her talents known with
                swift kills against unsuspecting enemies. Her fiery ambition has
                driven her to pursue heavily guarded targets, even at the risk
                of endangering her alliesâ€”but no matter the mission, Katarina
                will not hesitate to execute her duty amid a whirlwind of
                serrated daggers.

                The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions
                and fanciful creatures as she roams Runeterra with her fairy
                companion Pix. Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric
                of the world, and what she views as the constraints of this
                mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her magic
                at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone
                could use a touch of enchantment.

          League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
          multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
          Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
          Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
          the same genre.
